Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry. \n \n Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands."

The cloth face cover is not a substitute for social distancing."

If soap and water are not readily available, clean your hands with a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol."
